      <h1>The Clipboard Is the Most Underrated Interface</h1>

      <div class="page-body">
        <p>
          Every operating system ships with a clipboard. It's the oldest,
          simplest, most universal data transfer mechanism we have. Copy. Paste.
          Done.
        </p>

        <p>
          And yet, for decades, it's been treated as a single slot. One item in,
          one item out. The moment you copy something new, the old thing is
          gone. We've been working with a system that has the memory of a
          goldfish.
        </p>

        <hr class="dotted-line" />

        <p><strong>The copy-paste tax</strong></p>

        <p>
          Watch someone work for an hour. Count the number of times they switch
          windows to copy something, switch back, paste it, then go back again
          to copy the next thing. It's a shuttle run. Back and forth, tab to
          tab, window to window.
        </p>

        <p>
          This isn't a minor friction. It's a compounding one. Every context
          switch has a cognitive cost. Every time you leave what you're doing to
          go find that thing you need to paste, you lose a little bit of the
          thread you were holding. Multiply that by a hundred times a day, five
          days a week, and you've lost a meaningful chunk of your attention to
          clipboard logistics.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most tools try to solve this by adding integrations. Connect this app
          to that app. Set up a webhook. Configure an API. Clibbits takes the
          opposite approach: the clipboard is already universal. Every app
          already knows how to copy and paste. We just need the clipboard to be
          smarter about what it holds.
        </p>

        <hr class="dotted-line" />

        <p><strong>Information wants to be stacked</strong></p>

        <p>
          When you're preparing context for an AI assistant, filing a bug
          report, writing documentation, or briefing a colleague, you rarely
          need just one piece of information. You need three, or five, or eight
          things stitched together.
        </p>

        <p>
          The error log. The screenshot. The config file. The reproduction steps
          you just dictated. The relevant snippet from the docs. These all live
          in different places, and the traditional clipboard forces you to move
          them one at a time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Context stacking changes this. Add items to a stack from anywhere
          &mdash; clipboard history, transcription, screenshots &mdash; and
          paste them as a single block when you're ready. The stack is the unit
          of communication, not the individual copy.
        </p>

        <hr class="dotted-line" />

        <p><strong>Local first</strong></p>

        <p>
          Your clipboard contains some of the most sensitive data on your
          machine. Passwords. API keys. SSH commands. Private messages. The
          contents of files you're editing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Clibbits runs locally. Your clipboard history lives on your disk in
          JSON files. The OCR runs locally via Tesseract.js. Transcription
          happens on your machine. The only feature that touches the network is
          AI processing, and that's optional &mdash; you bring your own API key
          and can leave it unconfigured entirely.
        </p>

        <p>
          We filter out sensitive content by default. The ignore patterns
          setting lets you define regexes for content that should never be saved
          &mdash; password fields, token patterns, whatever you need excluded.
          The clipboard sees everything; Clibbits doesn't have to.
        </p>

        <hr class="dotted-line" />

        <p><strong>The clipboard as a workspace</strong></p>

        <p>
          The conventional clipboard is a pipe. Data goes in one end and comes
          out the other. Clibbits reimagines it as a workspace. A place where
          information accumulates, gets organized, gets enriched, and gets
          assembled into something useful before it goes where it's going.
        </p>

        <p>
          Boards give you spatial organization. Hot links give you actionable
          context. OCR makes images searchable. AI processing transforms raw
          content. Stacking lets you compose. Source tracking gives you
          provenance. Transcription gives you voice as an input channel.
        </p>

        <p>
          None of these features require you to change how you work. You still
          copy and paste. You just get more out of it.
        </p>

        <hr class="dotted-line" />

        <p><strong>Small tools, sharp edges</strong></p>

        <p>
          Clibbits isn't trying to be a second brain or an everything app. It's
          a clipboard manager. It sits in your menu bar, stays out of the way,
          and does its job. When you need it, it's there. When you don't, it's
          invisible.
        </p>

        <p>
          The best tools are the ones you forget you're using until someone asks
          how you found that thing so fast.
